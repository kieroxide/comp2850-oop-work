# Task 7.7.2

Put your solution to this task in the file `Contacts.kt`.

Edit the file named Contacts.kt, in the tasks/task7_7_2 subdirectory of your repository.

In this file, write a Kotlin program to simulate a database of contacts and their telephone numbers. Use a map of strings onto strings to represent this database.

Your program should repeatedly prompt the user to enter a contact’s name. If the name is present in the map, the program should display the corresponding phone number; otherwise, it should prompt for entry of that person’s phone number and then store the pairing of name and number in the map.
